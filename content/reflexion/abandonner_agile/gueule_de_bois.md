Transitioning from one culture to another was not easy. Companies needed
external help to transform their organization and a huge demand for a new
type of professional emerged: Agile coaches. Many Agile certification
schemes were created. **Some certifications could be obtained by simply attending a two-day training course.**

Selling Agile processes to middle managers was an easy sell—they all wanted
software to be delivered faster. “Engineering is the easy part. If we fix the
process, engineering will be fixed,” managers were told. “It’s always a people
problem.” And they bought it. Managers manage people, and as long as they
are in charge, they are happy to have their direct reports working faster.

Many companies truly benefited from their Agile transformation, and today
they are in a much better place than they were before. Many of these
companies can deploy software to production multiple times a day and have
business and technology truly working as a single team. But that is certainly
not true for many others. **Managers willing to push developers to work faster are using the full transparency of the process to micromanage them**. Agile
coaches with neither business nor technical experience are coaching managers
and telling development teams what to do. Roadmaps and milestones are
being defined by managers and forced upon development teams—developers
can estimate the work, but they are pushed hard to fit their estimates into the
imposed milestones. It is fairly common to see projects that have all their
iterations and respective user stories already defined by management for the
next 6 to 12 months. Failing to deliver all story points in a sprint means
developers must work harder in the next sprint to make up for the delay. Daily
standup meetings become meetings where developers must report progress to
product owners and Agile coaches, detailing what they are working on and
when they will be done. If the product owner thinks developers are spending
too much time on things like automated tests, refactoring, or pairing, they
simply tell the team to stop doing it.

**Strategic technical work has no place in their Agile process**. **There is no need for architecture or design. The order is to simply focus on the highest-priority item in the backlog and get it done as fast as possible—one highest-priority item after another.** This approach results in a long sequence of iterative tactical work and accumulation of technical debt. Fragile software, the
famous monoliths (or distributed monoliths for the teams trying micro
services) become the norm. Bugs and operational problems are popular
discussion topics during daily standup meetings and retrospectives. Releases
to production are not as frequent as the business expected. Manual testing
cycles still take days, if not weeks, to complete. And the hope that adopting
Agile would prevent all these issues is gone. **Managers blame developers for not moving quickly enough**. **Developers blame managers for not allowing them to do the technical and strategic work needed**. **Product owners do not consider themselves as part of the team and do not share the responsibility when things go wrong**. The us-versus-them culture reigns dominant.

That is what we call the *Agile Hangover*. After years of investment in an Agile
transformation, companies realized that they still have many of the problems
they had before. And Agile is being blamed for that, of course.
