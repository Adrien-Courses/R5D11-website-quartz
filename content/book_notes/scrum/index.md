Ce livre permet de comprendre le *pourquoi?* derrière Scrum.

## A new way of thinking
Les pages 7 à 10 nous expliquent les raisons derrière le framework Scrum

> The reason this framework works is simple. I looked at how people actually work, rather than how they say they work. I looked at research done over decades and at best practices in companies all over the world, and I looked deeply at the best teams within those companies.

> Traditionally, management wants two things on any project: control and
predictability. This leads to vast numbers of documents and graphs and charts, just
like at Lockheed. Months of effort go into planning every detail, so there will be no
mistakes, no cost overruns, and things will be delivered on schedule

> Scrum embraces uncertainty and creativity. It places a structure around the
learning process, enabling teams to assess both what they’ve created and, just as
important, how they created it.

> **At its root, Scrum is based on a simple idea: whenever you start a project, why not regularly check in**. That’s what’s called an “Inspect and Adapt” cycle

## The Origins of Scrum

> The best companies used an
overlapping development process that was faster and more flexible. The teams were
cross-functional. The teams had autonomy. They were empowered to make their own
decisions. And they had a transcendent purpose. They were reaching for something
bigger than themselves. (p 33)

> The basic idea is to measure exactly what is being done,
and how well, and to strive for “continuous improvement.
” Don’t just get better once;
get better constantly. Always be looking for something to improve.

> Forget trust-building exercises, and instead build trust every single day. (p149)
