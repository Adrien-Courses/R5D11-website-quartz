> This Expansion Pack **doesn’t replace the Scrum Guide**; it **complements it** for those needing more clarity in today’s context. The goal wasn’t to add rules, but to reinforce the spirit of Scrum, around product thinking, emergence, and strategic focus. It helps teams learn fast, adapt, and deliver value, even in uncertain, accelerated, tech-driven settings.
